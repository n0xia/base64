# Plaintext to Base64 converter
This Base64 converter follows standard procedure for converting plaintext ascii to a Base64 string.

## Extras

The extras are three extra versions of the original implementation.

base64-commented.cpp is a version where every single step is explained.

base64-plain.cpp is a version with no comments.

base64-verbose.cpp is a verbose option where every single step is shown fully.

There is only an executable for the verbose option because the two other versions are functionally the same.
