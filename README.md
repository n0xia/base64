# **Plaintext to Base64 converter**

This Base64 converter follows standard procedure for converting plaintext ascii to a Base64 string.

***

## *Extras*

The extras are three extra versions of the original implementation.  
 - base64-commented.cpp is a version where every single step is explained.
 - base64-plain.cpp is a version with no comments.
 - base64-verbose.cpp is a verbose option where every single step of the Base64 conversion is displayed in the terminal in all of its glory.

There is only an executable for the verbose option because the two other versions in /extras are *functionally the same*.

***

I mostly used the [Wikipedia page for Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) to learn the Base64 design and process.

The .out files in /executables are Linux executables (ELF 64-bit LSB pie executable for x86-64 processor architecture)
