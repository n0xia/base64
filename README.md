# **Plaintext to Base64 converter**

This Base64 converter follows standard procedure for converting plaintext ascii to a Base64 string.

***

## *Extras*

The extras are three extra versions of the original implementation.  
 - base64-commented.cpp is a version where every single step is commented in detail.
 - base64-verbose.cpp is a verbose option where every single step of the Base64 conversion is displayed in the terminal in all of its glory.
 - base64-clargs.cpp is a command line version that uses command line arguments as input

***

I mostly used the [Wikipedia page for Base64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64) to learn the Base64 design and process.

The .out files in executables/ are Linux executables (64-bit ELF, LSB, PIE executable for x86-64 processor architecture).
